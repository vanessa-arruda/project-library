# project-library

Project to build a Library of cards using HTML, CSS, JavaScript(DOM).
Implemented filters, multiple filters interactions, sortlist (dropdown button), and a simple search bar.

## The problem

Created an Array of objects with Pokemon theme to display multiple cards and properties values for each of the objects (Pokemons). The user will be able to search via text input and filter by Type or Region, as sort the display of cards by name, IDs and Max CP (in asceding and descending orders).
